    <div id="content">
        <p>Examine the cube's face and locate an edge piece that matches the center color. <br>
        For example, if the center is white, find an edge with white. <br>
        Position the edge piece by rotating the right face (R) clockwise, then turning <br>
        the upper face (U) clockwise, and finally rotating the front face (F) clockwise. <br>
        Repeat this process for all four edges to create a cross on the chosen face.
        </p>
        <p>In this step, your goal is to finish the first layer of the Rubik's Cube.<br>
            Look for corner pieces that have two colors matching the adjacent centers. <br>
            For instance, if you spot a corner with both orange and white, and it should <br>
            fit between the orange and white centers, you're on the right track. <br>
            To achieve this, you'll use a sequence of moves involving the front face <br>
            (F) and the upper face (U). By applying these moves and repeating the process <br>
            for all four corners, you'll quickly build the initial layer of your solved cube.</p>
        <p>In the third step, you'll tackle the middle layer of the Rubik's Cube. <br>
            Your goal is to correctly position the middle layer edge pieces. <br>
            To do this, look for an edge piece that has one color matching the <br>
            center of an adjacent face. Employing a specific sequence of moves <br>
            involving the right face (R) and the upper face (U), you'll smoothly <br>
            slide the edge piece into its designated spot. This sequence repeats <br>
            for all four middle layer edges, effectively placing them where they belong.</p>
        <p>The fourth step marks the approach to completing the Rubik's Cube's final <br>
            layer. The initial challenge here is to orient the corners, ensuring that <br>
            their colors align with the center faces. This is achieved through a <br>
            set sequence of moves, including rotations of the right face (R) <br>
            and the upper face (U). Once all corners are correctly oriented, <br>
            you're prepared for the final showdown of step 5.</p>
        <p>The fifth and final step involves permuting the remaining <br>
                final layer edges. Your aim is to rearrange these edges <br>
            into their proper positions. This step requires a bit more <br>
            complexity and uses a prescribed sequence of moves and <br>
            algorithms, including rotations of the right face (R) <br>
                and the upper face (U). By following these precise <br>
            sequences, you'll ultimately reach the coveted solved state <br>
            of the Rubik's Cube, where all colors align on their respective faces.</p>

    <h2 id = "subheading2">CFOP Method</h2>
    <div id="content2">
        <p>The first step is to create a cross on one face, usually the white face. <br>
                To do this, identify the edge pieces with the white color and <br>
            position them correctly, matching them with their respective <br>
                centers. This requires precise rotations and maneuvers, including <br>
            the use of the front (F), right (R), and upper (U) faces. <br>
                Achieving the cross sets the stage for the subsequent layers.</p>
        <p>In the F2L step, the solver pairs corner and edge pieces and <br>
                inserts them into their proper positions within the first <br>
            two layers simultaneously. This technique optimizes efficiency <br>
            and is considered one of the most crucial steps in CFOP. <br>
            Solvers aim to complete these layers without having to <br>
                return to the first layer, increasing solving speed significantly.</p>
        <p>Next comes the OLL step, where the solver focuses on orienting all <br>
                the pieces on the last layer. This involves recognizing and <br>
            executing algorithms to ensure that all the pieces on the <br>
            last layer face the correct direction. These algorithms are <br>
                essential for efficient solving and bring the cube closer to its solved state.</p>
        <p>The final step, PLL, revolves around permuting the pieces on the <br>
                last layer. Solvers use algorithms to move individual <br>
            pieces to their intended positions while keeping the <br>
            orientation achieved in the previous step (OLL) intact. <br>
                This completes the Rubik's Cube, aligning all its colors on <br>
                their respective faces, marking the successful conclusion of the CFOP method.</p>
